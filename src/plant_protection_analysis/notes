todo:
- freq of crops per month
- analysis of crop diseases w.r.t states
- analysis of crop diseases w.r.t months

done:
- converted to ~200K distinct queries from ~300K by using keywords
- converted to ~100K distinct queries by keeping only some crops
- tried TFIDF to extract features and k-means for clustering but both didn't gave good results so switched to manual labelling
- made state wise plots for paddy, cotton

issues:


facts:
- 326956 distinct queries(non-distinct = 1,111,773, overall total = 6110014) with label 'Plant Protection'(18% of total queries)
- ~77% of the plant protection queries are based on only 24 crops out of 272 crops(can make a small pie chart of it-top_crop_count.{txt,py})
- paddy: 91% queries are covered. paddy_rem.txt and paddy_freq.txt
- cotton: 90% queries are covered. cotton_rem.txt and cotton_freq.txt
- wheat: 87.7% ------------------------------------------------------
